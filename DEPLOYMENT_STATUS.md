## ⚠️ Render Deployment Issue

**Problem:** Render is serving an old cached version (3-column interface from earlier mistake)

**Solution:** Manually trigger a redeploy in Render dashboard

## How to Force Render to Deploy the Correct Version

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your `supermen-v8` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
5. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## What You'll See After Correct Deployment

- ✨ Purple/pink gradient "Build My App" button
- 🔷 5 floating hexagonal build step cards
